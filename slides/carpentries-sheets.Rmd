## Motivation and warm up

Most projects start with spreadsheets

* How can you structure the data for a smooth workflow?

* How can you handle dates safely?

* How can you avoid poor data?

* How can you export the data to ensure it'll be useful in the future?

## What is tidy data? Why bother?



# Your turn | Clean up the data (15')



## Tricky dates



# Discuss | What can you do to control the quality of your data?



# Demo | Data validation...



# Your turn | Export your data as .csv.



# Discuss | Assuming data is now tidy, What other problems may it still have?
